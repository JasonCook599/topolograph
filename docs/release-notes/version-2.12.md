# Topolograph

## v2.12 (09.01.2021)

### Enhancements
* Added 2 buttons for changing scale of topology for working with Sparse/Dense networks. It allows squeezing Dense topologies as well as stretch Sparse ones. Additionally, it's possible to "freeze" nodes, allocate nodes as you wish, and checks connections more easily.
